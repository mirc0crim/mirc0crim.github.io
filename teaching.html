							Even though there is no unique correct way to conduct scientific research, the main objective is to present general methods and skills that will help the students do research efficiently.

						<b>Author Verification over Topically Diverse Text Streams</b><br/>
						September 2016 - February 2017<br/>

                        <span>
                            This thesis deals with the problem of author verification, which is one of the most challenging tasks in style-based text categorization.
                            Author verification is the task of determining whether documents of unknown authorship are written by a certain author.
                            The set of possible candidates is not always limited to a given finite closed set.
                            In particular, we focus on two datasets, one related to political speeches and one related to newspaper articles.
                            The main goal was to determine whether two unknown texts (possibly cross-genre) are written by the same author.
                            Experiments with a variety of style-based features were tested in a supervised classification system using two distances, namely Delta and SPATIUM-L1.

						<b>Limits of Deep Learning</b><br/>
						February 2016 - June 2016<br/>
						Research project in the Master program<br/>
						<i>two students</i><br/>
						<span>
							Current natural language models try to capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words.
							This allows them to answer questions in the form of analogies: "X is to Y as U is to ?".
							The performance of the word2vec tool was studied on this task.
							To this end, the sensitivity to different hyperparameter choices was analyzed.
							The models (in)ability to learn and answer on domain-specific knowledge was demonstrated.
							To increase the models accuracy on solving analogies, a mean-shift procedure was proposed as a preliminary step to compute the query vector.
							The effectiveness of various combination of analogy interpretations for solving for the most similar word-vector are tested on a generalised question set.

						<b>Automatic Gender Detection in Written Texts</b><br/>
						February 2015 - June 2015<br/>
						Research project in the Master program<br/>
						<span>
							Nowadays a lot of research is made in gender recognition for written texts.
							However, the algorithms are mostly complex and often exhaustive to the English language.
							The purpose of this research was to explain a simplified version of a gender-recognition algorithm and test it on two languages (English and Spanish) to determine if there are accuracy changes or if the algorithm performs equally on different languages.
							Three distinct variants of the algorithm were discussed in this work and compared in terms of accuracy and speed.
