						<b>UniNE at CLEF 2016 Author Clustering: Notebook for PAN at CLEF 2016</b>.<br/>
						Mirco Kocher.<br/>
						<i>Proceeding CLEF-2016, Working Notes</i> (to appear).<br/>
						<span>This notebook describes and evaluates an effective unsupervised author clustering model.  The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different languages (such as Dutch, English, and Greek) in different genres (newspaper articles and reviews).  Applying a simple distance measure, we determine whether there is enough indication that two texts were written by the same author.  The proposed clustering performs very well (rank 2 over all test collections) in a comparison of 8 approaches.</span>

						<b title="text">UniNE at CLEF 2016 Author Profiling: Notebook for PAN at CLEF 2016</b>.<br/>

						<i>Proceeding CLEF-2016, Working Notes</i> (to appear).<br/>
						<span>This notebook describes and evaluates a cross-genre author profiling model.  The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different Indo-European languages.  Applying a simple distance measure and looking at the five nearest neighbors, we can determine the gender (male or female) and the age group (18-24 | 25-34 | 35-49 | 50-64 | >65).  The proposed cross-genre profiling performs acceptable (rank 15 over all test collections) in a comparison of 23 approaches.</span>

						<b>A Simple and Efficient Algorithm for Authorship Verification</b>.<br/>
						Mirco Kocher & Jacques Savoy.<br/>
						<i>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</i> (to appear).<br/>
						<span>This paper describes and evaluates an unsupervised and effective authorship verification model.  The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different Indo-European languages (such as Dutch, English, Spanish, and Greek) or genres (essay, novel, review, and newspaper article).  Applying a simple distance measure and a set of impostors, we can determine whether or not the disputed text was written by the proposed author.  Moreover, based on a simple rule, we can define when there is enough evidence to propose an answer or when the attribution scheme is unable to take a decision with a high degree of certainty.  Evaluations based on six test collections (PAN CLEF 2014 evaluation campaign) indicate that our approach usually appears in the top three best verification systems, and on an aggregate measure, presents the best performance.</span>

						<b>UniNE at CLEF 2015 Author Identification: Notebook for PAN at CLEF 2015</b>.<br/>

						In Capellato, L., Ferro, N., Jones, F. J. F., & Juan, E. S. (Eds), <i>Proceeding CLEF-2015, Working Notes</i>, Aachen: CEUR. <a target="_blank" href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1391/28-CR.pdf">PDF</a><br/>
						<span>This notebook presents and evaluates an unsupervised authorship verification model.  The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different languages with their genre and topic differ significantly.  Applying a simple distance measure and a set of impostors, we determine whether or not the disputed text was written by the proposed author.  The proposed identification usually performs well (rank 8 over all test collections) in a comparison of 19 approaches.</span>

						<span>This notebook presents and evaluates an effective author profiling model.  The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different languages in Twitter tweets.  We can determine the gender (male and female), the age group (18-24 | 25-34 | 35-49 | >50), and the Big Five personality traits (each on an interval scale containing eleven items).  The proposed profiling performs well (rank 4 over all test collections) in a comparison of 23 approaches.</span>
