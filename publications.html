                            This paper presents the author clustering problem and compares it to related authorship attribution questions.
                            The proposed model is based on a distance measure called SPATIUM derived from the Canberra measure (weighted version of L1 norm).
                            The selected features consist of the 200 most frequent words and punctuation symbols.
                            An evaluation methodology is presented and the test collections are extracted from the PAN CLEF 2016 evaluation campaign.
                            In addition to those, we also consider two additional corpora reflecting the literature domain more closely.
                            Based on four different languages, the evaluation measures demonstrate a high precision and high F1 values for all 20 test collections.
                            A more detailed analysis provides reasons explaining some of the failures of the SPATIUM model.

                            In French.
                            This paper describes the author clustering problem where, based on a set of n texts, the number k of distinct authors must be determined and the texts must be regrouped into k classes according to their author.
                            Using two test collections, one written in French, the second in English, different distance measures are described and evaluated.
                            To define the needed features, the m most frequent words (e.g., m between 50 to 300) or the m letters and bigrams of letters have been used.
                            Our experiments show that word-based representations offer usually the best performance.
                            Using the cosine distance function does not produce a better F1 value compared to functions based on the L1 norm (e.g., Canberra).
                            However, the best distance measure for all cases cannot be defined precisely.
                            Applying a bootstrap approach, we show that the performance measures own a relatively large variability.
                            Finally, a deeper analysis indicates the difficulties and reasons explaining incorrect assignments.

						<b>Distance Measures in Author Profiling</b>.<br/>
						Mirco Kocher &amp; Jacques Savoy.<br/>
						<i>submitted</i>. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacques_Savoy/publication/311174449_Distance_Measures_in_Author_Profiling/links/583ecd7808ae8e63e617db2d.pdf">PDF</a><br/>

							Determining some demographics about the author of a document (e.g., gender, age) has attracted many studies during the last decade.
							To determine the targeted category, different distance measures have been suggested without one approach clearly dominating all others.
							In this paper, 24 distance measures are studied, extracted from five general families of functions.
							Moreover, six theoretical properties are presented and we show that the Tanimoto or Matusita distance measures respect all proposed properties.
							To complement this analysis, 13 test collections extracted from the last CLEF evaluation campaigns are employed to evaluate empirically the effectiveness of these distance measures.
							The empirical evaluations indicate that the Canberra or Clark distance measures tend to produce better effectiveness, at least in the context of an author profiling task.

						<b>A Simple and Efficient Algorithm for Authorship Verification</b>.<br/>
						Mirco Kocher &amp; Jacques Savoy.<br/>
						<i>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</i>, 68(1), 2017, 259-269. <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23648/epdf">PDF</a><br/>
						<span>
							This paper describes and evaluates an unsupervised and effective authorship verification model.
							The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different Indo-European languages (such as Dutch, English, Spanish, and Greek) or genres (essay, novel, review, and newspaper article).
							Applying a simple distance measure and a set of impostors, we can determine whether or not the disputed text was written by the proposed author.
							Moreover, based on a simple rule, we can define when there is enough evidence to propose an answer or when the attribution scheme is unable to take a decision with a high degree of certainty.
							Evaluations based on six test collections (PAN CLEF 2014 evaluation campaign) indicate that our approach usually appears in the top three best verification systems, and on an aggregate measure, presents the best performance.

							This notebook describes and evaluates an effective unsupervised author clustering model.
							The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different languages (such as Dutch, English, and Greek) in different genres (newspaper articles and reviews).
							Applying a simple distance measure, we determine whether there is enough indication that two texts were written by the same author.
							The proposed clustering performs very well (rank 2 over all test collections) in a comparison of 8 approaches.

							This notebook describes and evaluates a cross-genre author profiling model.
							The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different Indo-European languages.
							Applying a simple distance measure and looking at the five nearest neighbors, we can determine the gender (male or female) and the age group (18-24 | 25-34 | 35-49 | 50-64 | &gt;65).
							The proposed cross-genre profiling performs acceptable (rank 14 over all test collections) in a comparison of 23 approaches.
