				<h1>teaching assistant</h1>
				<p>
					I am (or was) a teaching assistant in the following courses at UniNe. The course material is available on our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ilias.unibe.ch/">Ilias</a> collaborative learning platform. Students must first register to a course before being allowed to see its content.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Machine Learning and Data Mining</b>
						<br/>Jacques Savoy (Fall 2014, Fall 2015)<br/>
						Introduction to Data Mining perspective; Association rules; Decision trees; Instance-based learning (nearest neighbors); Clustering; Support Vector machines (SVM); Evaluation (Train & Test, Cross-validation, Leaving-one-out); Data Streams.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Seminar Natural Language Processing</b>
						<br/>Jacques Savoy (Fall 2014, Fall 2015)<br/>
						 Conduct your own research (on a limited amount of data) based on one/few scientific papers. Implement correctly a given algorithm; Test it; Understand its weakness; Analyse its behavior; Evaluate its performance (comparative basis, statistical tests); Discover the limit(s) of the proposed model.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Natural Language Processing</b>
						<br/>Jacques Savoy (Spring 2015)<br/>
						Introduction to Python and XML; Introduction to linguistics (morphology, syntax, semantics); simple statistical approaches (KWIC, concordances); Spelling detection and correction; Statistical models (counting words, bigrams, entropy); Parsing; Markov chains; Hidden Markov chains; Text categorization, sentiment analysis, authorship attribution; Cryptography; Question/Answering; Text summarization. The final mark is based on both a final written exam and the results of the practical exercises.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>R&D Workshop</b>
						<br/>Peter Kropf, Hugues Mercier, and Jacques Savoy (Spring 2015)<br/>
						Even though there is no unique correct way to conduct scientific research, the main objective is to present general methods and skills that will help the students do research efficiently. Work on a reading/writing research project. This may include reading scientific articles on a given topic, extending an existing algorithm, do a comprehensive survey of the state of the art techniques in a specific field. The students will write a report in the form of a scientific paper.
